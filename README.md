# DRIADfigs: scripts to fully reproduce manuscript figures

This repository is a companion to Drug Repurposing In Alzheimer's Disease (DRIAD), a machine learning framework for quantifying potential associations between drugs and Alzheimer's Disease.

To reproduce figures from the manuscript, descend into the `figures` subdirectory and run `Rscript` on the corresponding `.R` file(s). For example, to reproduce Figure 1, use the following commands:

``` sh
cd figures
Rscript Fig1.R
```
