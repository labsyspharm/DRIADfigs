  \caption*{\textbf{Supplementary Fig. 1: Performance of predictors trained on randomly-selected sets of genes plotted as a function of the set size.} Performance was evaluated through leave-pair-out cross-validation and displayed as area under the ROC curve (AUC). The three panels correspond to binary classification tasks comparing early (“A”), intermediate (“B”) and late (“C”) disease stages. The color scheme, as introduced in Fig. 1b, denotes the dataset and brain region (specified as Brodmann Area) of samples used in each analysis.}
